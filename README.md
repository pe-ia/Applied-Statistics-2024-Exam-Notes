My personal exam notes for the Spring 2024 Applied Statistics course at ITU. Loosely based on videos by @BrandonFoltz on YouTube. This does not follow the textbook, but should have the vast majority of what is covered in the course. 

There are also some instructions on how to get certain values on a TI-84 Plus CE-T calculator instead of using distribution tables. If you have the same calculator these notes could prove very useful for your exam.
